Introduction
</font>
<br/><br/>

XLANG is an x86 high level language compiler that generate x86 assembly
language.<br/>
The syntax of the language is similar to those of C like languages.
<br/>
It generates NASM 80x86 assembly language code. 
<br/>
Only ELF32 format is
supported for compiling, assembling and linking the code. 
<br/>But users are free to
assembly and link code in any format after compiling.
<br/>
The compiler is not the fully
functional that supports all features provided as per grammar rules at final x86 code
generation.Compiler still lack of features such as abstract types such as records
handling, better support for pointers, double precision floating points, more than
one predicate handling in conditional as well as in loops. So these features can be
used using inline assembly.
